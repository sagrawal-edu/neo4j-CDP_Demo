# neo4j-CDP_Demo



## Simple Demo of building a CDP on neo4j Aura platform
This repo holds the files for demo on a basic CDP built on neo4j Aura platform.
The files are named systematically, such as Step1, Step 2 & onwards
Each file contains the neo4j cypher code that one can copy/paste into neo4j/aura query browser



## Demo Overview
In this demo, we are creating following-
* 4 Customer Types with complex hierarchical relationships
* Multiple Address Types per customer (ship-to, bill-to, pay-to)
* 18 Products across multiple categories with color attributes
* 7 Orders spanning different time periods
* Intelligent Recommendations based on purchase patterns
* 10+ Demonstration Queries showcasing business value
* 5 Visualization Strategies for impressive demos



## Key Features of Demo
Main features demonstrated in this demo are-
* Relationship Power: Traditional databases struggle with multi-level hierarchies - graph databases make it natural
* Real-Time Recommendations: Query runs in milliseconds vs. minutes for SQL joins
* Flexible Schema: Easy to add new relationship types and attributes
* Business Insights: Color preferences, accessory recommendations, corporate family insights
* Scalability: This pattern scales to millions of customers and billions of relationships
   


## Possible next steps
Once the demo is fully setup (using steps 1 thru Step 7 files), perhaps you can try-
* Run all queries and verify results (Step 6 & Step 7 files)
* Customize product catalog for your industry
* Add more complex recommendation logic
* Integrate with real data sources via APIs
* Add more customers and orders for realistic scale demo
